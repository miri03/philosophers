make and init a struct with all infos “forks …..”
check the infos “being positive digits” “not less than 60”
a struct with individual infos about philos ”last meal / id / thread id/ struct to all the infos”
make mutex /allocate for forks/ and philo structs

>create_philo 
=>get the init time / send to the function each time the struct of the philo / grab forks (philo->id && philo->id +1 % n_philo) / eat update last meal time / put forks / sleep & think
at the end => join_threads / destroy mutex

if time parameters equal to zero

[200]         => 500
[700]

now - to_die > last_meal === died ???

last_meal + to_die < now === died
